# ICHOMFhirQuestionaireClient

This project implements a windows client with an embedded browser that loads the nih LHC-Forms package to allow viewing and editing of a fhir questionaire resource.
https://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/versions/13.x/index.html

The current ICHOM questionaires are included and can each be loaded, data entered, and the results read back.

This is a work in progress, and is not meant to be a fully functioning system.

This project was written to be used the the Sep 2022 HL7 Fhir Connectathon, and is freelt available to anyone who wants to implement a quick and simple windows FHIR questionaire client.
